Context

Most of the modern websites use images in some form or the other in their content. For example, e-
commerce websites commonly have pages showing a list of products with the productsâ€™ images.

Whenever you navigate to a web page that has one or more images in it, the browser tries to load those
images. And loading an image may take time depending upon the size of the image and the network of the
user. So sometimes images can take a lot of time to load. And usually how browsers behave is that until
the image has loaded, the browser would have nothing to show.
This is generally considered a bad user-experience because the user does not know if something is
expected in that content area but as soon as the image loads, it suddenly appears. So it is considered a
good practice to show a placeholder until the image has loaded. Facebook takes this practice to another
level by showing placeholder for the entire page until the content has loaded.


Usage
-----

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import FancyImageLoader from 'fancy-image-loader';

let placeholder = () => {
    return <img src="file/path/loading.gif"/>
}

let error = () => {
    return <img src="file/path/error.png"/>
}

let imageItem = "https://images.alphacoders.com/151/151291.jpg";

render(
  <FancyImageLoader 
        src={item}
        placeholder={placeholder}
        error ={error}
        class="img"
        alt = "Awesome image dude"
        key = {generateRandom()}
        style = {{borderRadius : '9px'}}
        height="200px"
        width="300px"></FancyImageLoader>
